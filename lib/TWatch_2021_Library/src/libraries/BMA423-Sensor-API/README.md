> This package contains BMA423 sensor API

## Sensor Overview
The BMA423 is an ultra-small, triaxial, low-g acceleration sensor with digital interfaces, aiming for low-power consumer electronics applications. Featuring 12 bit digital resolution and embedded intelligence, the BMA423 allows low-noise measurement of accelerations in 3 perpendicular and thus senses wrist tilt, tab/double tab and enables plug ’n’ play step counting especially in wearable devices.

### Features

- Step-counting in wearable devices
- Wake up display on wrist tilt
- Low power user interaction by tab/double tab
- Advanced gesture recognition
- Activity recognition/tracking
- Advanced power management for mobile devices
- Tilt compensation for electronic compass
